A **CDN (Content Delivery Network)** is a globally distributed network of servers
that delivers web content — like images, videos, stylesheets, and scripts —
to users **based on their geographic location**, ensuring **faster load times**,
**lower latency**, and **better reliability**.

## 🚀 Why Use a CDN?

| Benefit              | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| ⚡ **Speed**          | Serves content from the nearest edge server to the user |
| 🌍 **Global Reach**   | Reduces latency for users across continents |
| 🔐 **Security**       | Protects against DDoS attacks, adds HTTPS, and hides origin IP |
| 📈 **Scalability**    | Handles traffic spikes without overloading origin servers |
| 🛡️ **Reliability**    | Provides failover and redundancy in case of server outages |

## 🧠 How It Works

1. You upload your content (e.g., images, JS files) to your origin server.
2. The CDN caches this content across its global edge servers.
3. When a user requests a file, the CDN serves it from the **nearest edge node**, not your origin.

## 🧩 Real-World Example

Imagine your SaaS app has users in India, Germany, and Brazil:
- Without a CDN: All users hit your server in Mumbai → slow for Germany/Brazil
- With a CDN: Users in Germany get content from Frankfurt edge node,
Brazil from São Paulo → fast and smooth
