In Java, the order of execution for different components within a class is crucial to understand,
particularly when dealing with static blocks, instance initializer blocks, constructors, and methods.
Here's the order of execution:

Static Blocks:
Static blocks are executed when the class is loaded into memory. This happens only once,
at the start of the program or when the class is first referenced.
If there are multiple static blocks, they execute in the order they appear in the code.

main method:

Instance Initializer Blocks:
After static blocks, the instance initializer blocks are executed whenever an instance of the class is
created.
If there are multiple instance initializer blocks, they execute in the order they appear in the code.

Constructors:
Following the execution of instance initializer blocks, the constructor of the class is called.
If the constructor calls another constructor (using this()), that constructor's instance initializer
blocks and body will execute before returning to the calling constructor.

Methods:
Methods can be invoked at any point after the object is instantiated, but they do not have a predefined
order of execution relative to the other components unless explicitly called.


Example to Illustrate the Order
Hereâ€™s a simple example demonstrating the execution order:
class Example {
    // Static block
    static {
        System.out.println("Static Block");
    }
    // Instance initializer block
    {
        System.out.println("Instance Initializer Block");
    }
    // Constructor
    Example() {
        System.out.println("Constructor");
    }
    public void method() {
        System.out.println("Method");
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Main Method");
        Example ex = new Example(); // Creating an instance
        ex.method(); // Calling a method
    }
}

Output of the Example
When you run the above code, the output will be:
Static Block
Main Method
Instance Initializer Block
Constructor
Method

Summary of Execution Order

Static blocks (executed once when the class is loaded)
Main method (entry point of the program)
Instance initializer blocks (executed for each instance)
Constructor (executed for each instance)
Any methods called on the instance

This order ensures that the static context is fully initialized before any instance-specific logic is executed.
Understanding this execution order is essential for managing dependencies and initialization logic in Java classes.
