Creating a custom exception in programming allows you to define your own error-handling mechanisms tailored
to specific application needs. Below are steps and examples for creating custom exceptions in Java and Python,
two commonly used programming languages.

Creating a Custom Exception in Java
Extend the Exception Class: Create a new class that extends either Exception (for checked exceptions)
or RuntimeException (for unchecked exceptions).

Provide Constructors: Implement constructors to initialize the exception with a message and/or a cause.

Example:
// Custom exception class
public class MyCustomException extends Exception {

    // Constructor with a message
    public MyCustomException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }

    // Constructor with a message and cause
    public MyCustomException(String message, Throwable cause) {
        super(message, cause);
    }
}

// Usage of custom exception
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            throw new MyCustomException("This is a custom exception.");
        } catch (MyCustomException e) {
            System.out.println(e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}

Key Points
Checked vs. Unchecked Exceptions (Java): If you create a custom exception that extends Exception,
it will be a checked exception, which means it must be declared in the method signature using throws.
If it extends RuntimeException, it will be an unchecked exception, which does not require explicit
handling.

Message and Cause: Providing both a message and a cause can help in debugging by giving context about what went wrong and why.

Documentation: Always document your custom exceptions clearly so that other developers understand their purpose and usage.

Conclusion
Creating custom exceptions helps in managing errors more effectively, allowing for clearer error handling and improved code readability. By following the above patterns, you can easily implement custom exceptions in Java, Python, or similar languages.
