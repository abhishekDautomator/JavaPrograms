Designing a **URL Shortener** like Bitly involves multiple system design principles: scalability, performance, fault tolerance, and efficient storage. Here's a detailed breakdown tailored for your senior-level interview prep:

---

## 🏗️ 1. Functional Requirements
- Convert a long URL into a short, unique alias.
- Redirect short URL to the original long URL.
- Track analytics (clicks, timestamps, geolocation).
- Optional: Expiry time, custom aliases, user accounts.

---

## 🧱 2. High-Level Architecture

### 🔹 Components
- **API Gateway**: Handles incoming requests.
- **URL Shortening Service**: Generates and stores short URLs.
- **Redirect Service**: Resolves short URLs to long ones.
- **Database**: Stores mappings and metadata.
- **Cache**: Speeds up frequent lookups.
- **Analytics Service**: Tracks usage.

### 🔹 Flow
1. User submits long URL → API Gateway → Shortening Service.
2. Service generates short code → stores mapping in DB.
3. On access, short URL → Redirect Service → fetch long URL → redirect.

---

## 🔢 3. Short URL Generation Strategies

### ✅ Hashing
- Hash long URL (e.g., MD5, SHA256) → Base62 encode → truncate.
- Risk: collisions. Use collision detection or append salt.

### ✅ Counter-Based
- Auto-increment ID → Base62 encode.
- Simple and fast, but requires central counter (can be sharded).

### ✅ Random String
- Generate random 6–8 character string.
- Check for uniqueness in DB.

## 🗃️ 4. Database Design

### 🔹 Table: `url_mapping`
| Column        | Type       | Description                     |
|---------------|------------|---------------------------------|
| id            | BIGINT     | Primary key                     |
| short_code    | VARCHAR    | Unique short alias              |
| long_url      | TEXT       | Original URL                    |
| created_at    | TIMESTAMP  | Creation time                   |
| expires_at    | TIMESTAMP  | Optional expiry                 |
| user_id       | VARCHAR    | Optional user reference         |

### 🔹 Indexing
- Index `short_code` for fast lookup.
- TTL index for expiry (if using NoSQL like MongoDB).

---

## 🚀 5. Scalability & Performance

### ✅ Caching
- Use Redis to cache hot short codes.
- TTL for expiry.

### ✅ CDN
- Serve redirects via CDN for static short links.

### ✅ Load Balancing
- Use NGINX or ELB to distribute traffic.

### ✅ Partitioning
- Shard DB by short code prefix or user ID.

---

## 🔐 6. Security & Abuse Prevention

- Rate limiting (e.g., Redis counters).
- CAPTCHA for anonymous users.
- Blacklist malicious domains.

---

## 📊 7. Analytics (Optional)

- Track clicks, IP, user-agent, geolocation.
- Store in separate analytics DB (e.g., ClickHouse, Elasticsearch).
- Use Kafka for event streaming.

---

## 🧠 Interview Tip

If asked to design this:
- Start with **functional goals**, then move to **architecture**.
- Discuss **trade-offs**: hashing vs counter, SQL vs NoSQL.
- Mention **scalability strategies**: caching, sharding, CDN.
- Bonus: Talk about **eventual consistency** and **analytics pipeline**.
