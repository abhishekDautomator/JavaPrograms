The Strategy design pattern falls under the category of behavioral design patterns.
Explanation: This is because the Strategy pattern allows you to choose different algorithms or behaviors at runtime, essentially defining a set of interchangeable behaviors within an object, making it a behavioral design pattern.
Key points about the Strategy design pattern:
Dynamic algorithm selection:
The main feature is the ability to select which algorithm to use at runtime based on the situation.
Encapsulation of algorithms:
Different algorithms are encapsulated in separate classes, allowing for easy switching between them.
Flexibility:
This pattern promotes code flexibility by enabling you to change the behavior of an object without modifying its core logic.
