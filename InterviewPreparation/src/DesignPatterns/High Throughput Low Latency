What strategies would you use to handle high-throughput API traffic with low latency?

To handle **high-throughput API traffic with low latency**, especially in a cloud-native
microservices ecosystem, you need a blend of **architecture patterns**, **infrastructure
tuning**, and **smart caching**. Here's how I'd approach it,

## üöÄ 1. **Horizontal Scaling**
- Deploy stateless services behind a **load balancer** (e.g., NGINX, AWS ALB)
- Use **Kubernetes HPA** (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler) to scale pods based on CPU, memory,
or custom metrics
- Ensure services are **stateless** to allow seamless scaling

---

## ‚ö° 2. **Caching at Multiple Layers**
- **Client-side caching**: Use HTTP headers (`Cache-Control`, `ETag`) to reduce redundant calls
- **API Gateway caching**: Cache frequent GET responses at the edge (e.g., Cloudflare,
AWS API Gateway)
- **Redis/Memcached**: Cache computed results, leaderboard data, or user sessions
  ```java
  redisTemplate.opsForValue().get("user:123:profile");
  ```

---

## üß© 3. **Asynchronous Processing**
- Offload heavy tasks to background workers using **Kafka**, **RabbitMQ**, or **Spring @Async**
- Use **event-driven architecture** for non-blocking flows (e.g., audit logs, notifications)

---

## üß† 4. **Rate Limiting & Throttling**
- Prevent abuse and overload using:
  - **Bucket4j**, **Resilience4j RateLimiter**
  - API Gateway policies (e.g., 100 requests/min per IP)
- Apply **tenant-aware limits** in multi-tenant setups

---

## üîÄ 5. **Load Distribution & Sharding**
- Use **consistent hashing** to distribute load across shards (e.g., for leaderboards, logs)
- Partition databases or caches by region, tenant, or user ID

---

## üõ°Ô∏è 6. **Connection Pooling & Timeouts**
- Use **HikariCP** for efficient DB connection pooling
- Set **timeouts** for HTTP clients (RestTemplate, WebClient) to avoid hanging threads
  ```java
  WebClient.builder().responseTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(2))
  ```

---

## üîç 7. **CDN for Static & Semi-Dynamic Content**
- Serve static assets and semi-dynamic content (e.g., product listings) via CDN
- Reduces origin server load and improves global latency

---

## üìä 8. **Monitoring & Auto-Tuning**
- Use **Prometheus + Grafana** to monitor latency, throughput, error rates
- Auto-scale based on custom metrics (e.g., queue depth, request latency)
- Set up **SLO-based alerts** to catch degradation early

## üß† Real-World Example: SAP-Grade API Platform

Imagine a global HR SaaS:
- Redis caches top 100 employees per department
- Kafka handles async payroll processing
- Spring Boot services scale via Kubernetes
- API Gateway enforces rate limits and JWT auth
- Prometheus tracks latency per endpoint
- CDN serves org charts and avatars
