Designing a **global leaderboard system** with real-time updates and caching is a classic system design challenge ‚Äî perfect for showcasing your skills in scalability, consistency, and performance, Abhishek. Let‚Äôs architect it step-by-step.

## üåç Goal: Global Leaderboard System

### üîπ Requirements:
- Real-time score updates
- Global ranking across millions of users
- Fast read access (low latency)
- High write throughput (score updates)
- Caching and eventual consistency
- Fault tolerance and scalability

---

## üß± High-Level Architecture

```
Client ‚Üí API Gateway ‚Üí Leaderboard Service ‚Üí Score Processor ‚Üí Kafka
                                      ‚Üí Aggregator -> Redis + DB ‚Üí Cache Updater
```

## üîß Core Components

### 1. **Leaderboard Service (Spring Boot)**
- Exposes REST APIs:
  - `GET /leaderboard/top`
  - `POST /score/update`
- Stateless, horizontally scalable
- Uses Redis for fast reads, Kafka for async writes

---

### 2. **Score Processor**
- Validates and normalizes incoming scores
- Publishes to Kafka topic: `score-updates`

---

### 3. **Kafka (Event Stream)**
- Decouples write path from ranking logic
- Enables async processing and replayability
- Topic: `score-updates`

---

### 4. **Aggregator Service**
- Consumes Kafka events
- Updates Redis sorted sets (`ZADD`) for real-time ranking
- Periodically syncs to persistent DB (PostgreSQL or Cassandra)

---

### 5. **Redis (Caching Layer)**
- Stores leaderboard using **Sorted Sets**
  ```bash
  ZADD global_leaderboard 1500 "user123"
  ZREVRANGE global_leaderboard 0 9 WITHSCORES //This returns the top 10 users in the
  leaderboard, along with their scores, sorted from highest to lowest.
  ```
- Fast reads for top-N queries
- TTL or eviction policy for memory control

---

### 6. **Database (Durable Storage)**
- Stores historical scores, user metadata
- Used for analytics, recovery, and audit
- Write-behind strategy from Redis

---

## ‚ö° Real-Time Update Flow

1. User submits score ‚Üí API Gateway ‚Üí Leaderboard Service
2. Score published to Kafka
3. Aggregator updates Redis
4. Redis reflects updated ranking instantly
5. Periodic sync to DB for durability

## üõ°Ô∏è Scalability & Fault Tolerance

| Concern              | Solution |
|----------------------|----------|
| High read traffic    | Redis + CDN |
| High write traffic   | Kafka + async processing |
| Data loss            | Kafka durability + DB sync |
| Cache eviction       | TTL + DB fallback |
| Global latency       | Geo-distributed Redis + CDN |
| Failover             | Kubernetes + health checks |

---

## üß† Bonus Features

- **Sharded Leaderboards**: Per region, game mode, or season
- **User Metadata**: Avatar, country, badges
- **Pagination**: Cursor-based for infinite scroll
- **User Rank API**: `GET /leaderboard/rank/{userId}`
- **Notifications**: Push updates when rank changes

---

## üß™ Sample Redis Query

```bash
ZADD global_leaderboard 2500 "abhishek"
ZREVRANK global_leaderboard "abhishek"  # Get rank
ZREVRANGE global_leaderboard 0 9 WITHSCORES  # Top 10
```

## üß© Interview Tip

When asked to design this:
- Start with use cases
- Define read/write patterns
- Choose Redis for speed, Kafka for decoupling, DB for durability
- Discuss consistency trade-offs (eventual vs strong)
- Highlight monitoring, scaling, and fallback strategies
