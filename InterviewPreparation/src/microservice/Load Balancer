A **load balancer** is a system component ‚Äî either hardware or software ‚Äî that distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes overwhelmed. It's like a traffic cop for your web application, making sure requests are routed efficiently and reliably.

## ‚öôÔ∏è What Does a Load Balancer Do?

- **Distributes traffic**: Spreads incoming requests across multiple backend servers.
- **Improves performance**: Prevents bottlenecks and reduces latency.
- **Enhances reliability**: If one server fails, traffic is rerouted to healthy ones.
- **Supports scalability**: Easily add or remove servers without downtime.

## üß† Types of Load Balancing Algorithms

| Algorithm        | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Round Robin      | Sends requests to servers in a rotating order.                              |
| Least Connections| Sends traffic to the server with the fewest active connections.             |
| IP Hash          | Uses client IP to determine which server gets the request.                  |
| Weighted Round Robin | Prioritizes servers based on assigned weights (e.g., capacity).         |

## üß± Types of Load Balancers

- **Hardware Load Balancers**: Physical devices (e.g., F5, Cisco) used in enterprise setups.
- **Software Load Balancers**: Tools like NGINX, HAProxy, or cloud-based ones like AWS ELB.
- **Layer 4 (Transport Layer)**: Balances based on IP and TCP/UDP ports.
- **Layer 7 (Application Layer)**: Balances based on content (e.g., HTTP headers, cookies).

## üîê Bonus: Security Benefits
- Can help mitigate **DDoS attacks**.
- Acts as a **reverse proxy**, hiding backend server details.
- Supports **SSL termination**, offloading encryption tasks from servers.
