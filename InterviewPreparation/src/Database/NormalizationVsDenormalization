Normalization and de-normalization are two critical concepts in database management systems
(DBMS) that deal with the organization of data within a relational database. Each approach has its own
advantages and disadvantages, and they serve different purposes.
Normalization
Definition: Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and
improve data integrity. It involves dividing large tables into smaller, related tables and defining
relationships between them.

Objectives:

Eliminate Redundancy: Reduce duplicate data by structuring the database appropriately.
Improve Data Integrity: Ensure that data dependencies make sense and that changes to data are
consistently applied.
Simplify Data Maintenance: Make it easier to update, insert, or delete data without inconsistencies.

Normal Forms: Data is organized into various normal forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF, etc.), each with specific
rules regarding how data should be structured.
Example: Consider a table storing customer orders. In a normalized form, you might have separate tables
for customers, orders, and products, with foreign keys linking them together.

Advantages:
Reduced data redundancy.
Improved data integrity and consistency.
Easier to maintain and update data.

Disadvantages:
Complex queries may require multiple joins, which can slow down performance.
Increased number of tables can complicate database design and management.

De-normalization
Definition: De-normalization is the process of intentionally introducing redundancy into a database by
merging tables or incorporating redundant data to optimize read performance.

Objectives:
Improve Query Performance: By reducing the number of joins needed to retrieve data, queries can be
executed faster.
Simplify Queries: Fewer tables can lead to simpler SQL queries, making it easier for developers and
analysts to work with.

Example: In a denormalized structure, you might combine customer, order, and product information into a
single table for faster retrieval, even if it means duplicating some customer or product data.

Advantages:
Improved read performance due to fewer joins.
Simpler queries that are easier to understand and use.

Disadvantages:
Increased data redundancy can lead to anomalies during data updates, inserts, or deletes.
More complex data maintenance, as changes must be propagated to multiple locations.

Conclusion
In summary, normalization focuses on reducing redundancy and improving data integrity, while
denormalization aims to enhance performance, particularly for read-heavy applications. The choice
between normalization and denormalization depends on the specific requirements of the application,
including data access patterns, performance needs, and the importance of data integrity. Often, a
hybrid approach is used, where some parts of the database are normalized, and others are denormalized
based on their usage.
