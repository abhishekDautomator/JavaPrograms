Garbage collection (GC) is a form of automatic memory management in programming languages,
particularly in languages like Java, C#, and Python. It is responsible for reclaiming memory that is no
longer in use or accessible by the application, thereby preventing memory leaks and optimizing resource
utilization.

in Java, garbage collection primarily targets heap memory (including the method area),
while stack memory is managed automatically through the method call lifecycle.

Key Concepts of Garbage Collection

Memory Management: In programming, memory management involves allocating and freeing memory as needed.
Manual memory management can lead to errors such as memory leaks (failure to free unused memory)
or dangling pointers (references to freed memory). Garbage collection automates this process, minimizing
human error.

Heap Memory: Most garbage-collected languages allocate memory dynamically in a region called the heap.
Objects created at runtime are stored here, and the GC is responsible for identifying which objects are
still reachable (in use) and which can be reclaimed.

Reachability: An object is considered "reachable" if it can be accessed directly or indirectly through
references from active parts of the program (like stack frames). If no references point to an object,
it becomes eligible for garbage collection.

How Garbage Collection Works
Garbage collection typically involves several phases:

Marking: The GC identifies which objects are still reachable by traversing the reference graph starting
from the root objects (e.g., local variables, static fields). All reachable objects are marked.

Sweeping: After the marking phase, the GC scans the heap for unmarked objects (those not reachable).
These objects are deemed garbage and can be reclaimed.

Compacting: In some garbage collectors, after sweeping, the memory may become fragmented. Compaction
involves moving reachable objects together to eliminate gaps, making allocation of new objects more
efficient.

Types of Garbage Collectors
Different garbage collection algorithms have varying strategies for managing memory.
Some common types include:

Generational Garbage Collection: This approach is based on the observation that most objects
have a short lifespan. Memory is divided into generations (young, old, etc.), with frequent collections
in the young generation where most objects die quickly, while collections in the old generation are
less frequent.

Stop-and-Copy: This method divides the heap into two halves. During garbage collection, reachable objects
are copied from one half to the other, compacting them in the process. The unused half is then reclaimed
for future allocations.

Mark-and-Sweep: A straightforward technique that marks reachable objects and sweeps through the heap to
collect unmarked objects. It does not compact memory, which can lead to fragmentation.

Incremental and Concurrent Collectors: These collectors aim to reduce pause times by performing garbage
collection incrementally or concurrently with the application threads, allowing for more responsive
applications.

Java employs several garbage collection (GC) processes to manage memory automatically,
allowing developers to focus on application logic rather than manual memory management.
The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) provides different garbage collection algorithms,
each with its own characteristics and use cases. Hereâ€™s an overview of the various garbage collection
processes in Java:

1. Serial Garbage Collector

Description: The Serial GC uses a single thread for garbage collection, making it suitable for small applications or single-threaded environments.
How It Works:
During a young generation collection, it pauses all application threads (stop-the-world event).
It performs marking and sweeping in the young generation, and if necessary, it can also collect the old generation.

Use Case: Ideal for applications with small heaps or those running on client machines where low overhead is essential.

2. Parallel Garbage Collector (Throughput Collector)

Description: The Parallel GC uses multiple threads to perform garbage collection, aimed at maximizing
throughput and minimizing pause times.
How It Works:
Like the Serial GC, it pauses all application threads during the young generation collection but
utilizes multiple threads to perform the marking and sweeping phases.
It is designed to work efficiently with multi-core processors.

Use Case: Suitable for batch processing applications or server-side applications where throughput is
critical.

3. Concurrent Mark-Sweep (CMS) Collector

Description: The CMS collector minimizes pause times by performing most of its work concurrently with the
application threads.

How It Works:
The CMS collector has several phases: initial marking (stop-the-world), concurrent marking
(runs alongside application threads), remark (stop-the-world), and sweeping (concurrent).
It primarily collects the old generation and is optimized for reducing pause times.

Use Case: Best suited for applications that require low pause times and can tolerate some level of fragmentation.

4. G1 Garbage Collector (Garbage-First Collector)

Description: The G1 GC is designed for applications with large heaps and aims to provide predictable
pause times while maintaining high throughput.
How It Works:
The heap is divided into regions, and G1 prioritizes which regions to collect based on the amount
of garbage present (hence "Garbage-First").
It performs both young and old generation collections, using a concurrent marking phase to identify live objects and a mixed collection phase to reclaim memory.

Use Case: Suitable for applications requiring large heap sizes and predictable performance, such as big data processing and enterprise applications.

5. Z Garbage Collector (ZGC)

Description: ZGC is a low-latency garbage collector introduced in JDK 11 that aims to provide
very short pause times, even with large heaps (up to multi-terabyte sizes).
How It Works:
ZGC uses a technique called "colored pointers" to track object references, allowing it to perform
garbage collection concurrently without needing to stop the application threads for long periods.
It includes concurrent marking, relocation, and compaction phases.

Use Case: Ideal for applications requiring extremely low latency, such as real-time processing systems and high-frequency trading platforms.

6. Shenandoah Garbage Collector

Description: Shenandoah is a concurrent garbage collector that aims to minimize pause times by performing garbage collection concurrently with the application.
How It Works:
Similar to ZGC, Shenandoah allows for concurrent marking and evacuation, aiming to keep pause times short regardless of heap size.
It also implements a mechanism to relocate objects concurrently.

Use Case: Suitable for applications that demand low pause times and can benefit from concurrent processing.

Conclusion
Java's garbage collection processes are designed to address various application requirements,
ranging from low-latency needs to high-throughput scenarios. By understanding the different garbage collection algorithms and their characteristics, developers can choose the most appropriate garbage collector based on their application's specific performance and resource management needs. Each garbage collector comes with trade-offs regarding pause times, throughput, and memory footprint, so careful consideration is essential when configuring the JVM for optimal performance.

Advantages of Garbage Collection

Automatic Memory Management: Developers do not need to manually allocate and free memory, reducing the
risk of memory-related errors.

Improved Productivity: By abstracting memory management, developers can focus more on application logic
rather than low-level memory handling.

Safety: Garbage collectors help prevent memory leaks and dangling pointers, leading to more robust
applications.

Disadvantages of Garbage Collection

Performance Overhead: Garbage collection introduces some performance overhead due to the time spent on
identifying and reclaiming unused memory.

Unpredictable Pause Times: Garbage collection can lead to unpredictability in application performance,
especially during full collections or compaction, which may cause noticeable pauses.

Limited Control: Developers have less control over memory management compared to manual techniques,
which can be a drawback in performance-critical applications.

In summary, garbage collection is a vital component of memory management in modern programming languages, providing automated mechanisms to reclaim memory and enhance application stability. Understanding its workings and implications helps developers write efficient and effective code while leveraging the advantages of automated memory management.
