ArrayList vs LinkedLIst?

Great question, Abhishek! Since you're prepping for senior Java interviews, understanding the **differences between `ArrayList` and `LinkedList`**—and when to use each—is crucial. Here's a clear breakdown:

### ⚔️ ArrayList vs LinkedList in Java

| Feature                     | `ArrayList`                                      | `LinkedList`                                      |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Underlying Structure**   | Dynamic array                                    | Doubly linked list                                |
| **Access Time**            | Fast (O(1) for `get(index)`)                     | Slow (O(n) for `get(index)`)                      |
| **Insertion/Deletion**     | Slow (O(n) due to shifting elements)             | Fast (O(1) if at head/tail; O(n) otherwise)       |
| **Memory Usage**           | Less (stores only data)                         | More (stores data + pointers to next/prev nodes)  |
| **Iteration Performance**  | Better cache locality, faster iteration          | Slower iteration due to node traversal            |
| **Use Case**               | Best for frequent access/read operations         | Best for frequent insert/delete operations        |
| **Implements**             | `List`                                           | `List`, `Deque`                                   |

### 🧠 When to Use What

- ✅ Use **ArrayList** when:
  - You need **fast random access**
  - Insertions/deletions are **infrequent**
  - Memory efficiency matters

- ✅ Use **LinkedList** when:
  - You need **frequent insertions/deletions**, especially at the beginning or middle
  - You’re implementing **queues or stacks**
  - You don’t need fast random access

### 🔍 Interview Tip

If asked which one to use in a real-world scenario, always **justify based on access vs. mutation patterns**. For example:

> “If I’m building a cache where I frequently access elements by index, I’d go with `ArrayList`. But for a messaging queue where I enqueue and dequeue often, `LinkedList` is more appropriate.”

Want to dive into internal implementation or performance benchmarks next? I can walk you through how `ArrayList` resizes or how `LinkedList` nodes are structured in memory.
