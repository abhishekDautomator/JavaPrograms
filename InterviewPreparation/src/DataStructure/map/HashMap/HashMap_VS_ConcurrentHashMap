HashMap (Java 8 and later)
"HashMap is a part of the Java Collection Framework and provides a key-value based data structure that allows constant-time performance for get() and put() in the average case."

📌 Internal Implementation:
Buckets and Hashing:
It uses an array of buckets, where each bucket is a linked list or a tree (after threshold). The hash code of the key determines the bucket index.

Handling Collisions:
Initially uses a linked list, but if the number of entries in a bucket exceeds 8, it switches to a red-black tree for better performance (O(log n)).

Resizing:
When the number of entries exceeds capacity * loadFactor, the map resizes (typically doubling the array size), which rehashes all entries — a costly operation.

Nulls:
Allows one null key and multiple null values.

Not Thread-safe:
If multiple threads access a HashMap concurrently and at least one thread modifies it, you must synchronize externally, otherwise it may lead to data corruption.

✅ ConcurrentHashMap
"ConcurrentHashMap is a thread-safe alternative to HashMap, designed for high concurrency with minimal blocking."

📌 Internal Implementation:
Segmented Locking (Pre-Java 8):
Originally used segments (like mini hash tables with their own locks) for better concurrency.

Bucket-level Synchronization (Java 8+):
Now uses lock striping with synchronized blocks and CAS (Compare-And-Swap) using low-level operations from the Unsafe class.

No Full Locking:
Read operations are lock-free, and writes lock only specific buckets, not the entire map.

Handling Collisions:
Similar to HashMap (linked list → red-black tree).

Nulls Not Allowed:
Doesn’t allow null keys or values — avoids ambiguity in concurrent scenarios.

🔥 Key Differences
Feature	HashMap	ConcurrentHashMap
Thread-safe	❌ No	✅ Yes
Performance	Fast (single-threaded)	Optimized for multithreading
Null Keys	✅ 1 allowed	❌ Not allowed
Data Structure	Array + LinkedList/Tree	Same, but with fine-grained locking
Synchronization	External	Internal (bucket-level)
🎯 How to Finish:
“So overall, I’d choose HashMap for single-threaded or read-heavy scenarios where thread-safety isn't a concern. But for concurrent applications like caching, I'd go with ConcurrentHashMap due to its fine-grained locking and better performance under multi-threaded access.”
