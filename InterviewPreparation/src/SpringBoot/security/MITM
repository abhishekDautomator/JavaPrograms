A **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)** attack is a serious cybersecurity threat where an attacker secretly intercepts and possibly alters the communication between two parties who believe they are directly communicating with each other.

---

## 🕵️‍♂️ How It Works
- The attacker positions themselves between the client (e.g., your browser) and the server (e.g., your bank).
- They intercept the data being exchanged — such as login credentials, credit card numbers, or personal messages.
- The attacker can **read**, **modify**, or **inject** malicious content into the communication stream without either party knowing.

## 🔍 OWASP's Description
OWASP refers to this as a **Manipulator-in-the-Middle** attack. Here's how it typically unfolds:
- The attacker splits the original TCP connection into two:
  - One between the client and attacker.
  - One between the attacker and the server.
- The attacker acts as a **proxy**, relaying and potentially altering messages between the two parties.

## 🧪 Common Techniques
- **ARP Spoofing**: Faking MAC addresses to redirect traffic.
- **DNS Spoofing**: Redirecting users to malicious websites.
- **SSL Stripping**: Downgrading HTTPS to HTTP to expose data.
- **Session Hijacking**: Stealing session tokens to impersonate users.

## 🛡️ How to Prevent MITM Attacks
- Use **HTTPS** with valid SSL/TLS certificates.
- Implement **certificate pinning** in mobile apps.
- Avoid public Wi-Fi or use a **VPN**.
- Enable **multi-factor authentication** (MFA).
- Keep software and firmware updated.
