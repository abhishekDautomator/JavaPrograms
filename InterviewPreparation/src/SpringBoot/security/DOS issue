The **DoS (Denial of Service)** issue in OWASP refers to a type of attack that aims to make a
web application, server, or service **unavailable to legitimate users** by overwhelming it with
excessive requests or exploiting vulnerabilities.


## üö® What Is a DoS Attack?
A **Denial of Service** attack targets the **availability** of a system. It can be executed by:
- Flooding the server with traffic until it crashes or becomes unresponsive.
- Exploiting programming or resource-handling flaws (e.g., memory leaks, infinite loops).
- Sending malformed requests that consume excessive CPU or memory.

## üß© OWASP's Perspective
According to OWASP:
- DoS attacks can be **network-based**, **application-based**, or **logic-based**.
- They may involve **resource exhaustion**, such as CPU, memory, disk space, or database connections.
- In some cases, attackers may inject and execute code during a DoS attack to gain unauthorized access.

## üõ°Ô∏è How to Mitigate DoS Risks
- **Rate limiting**: Restrict the number of requests per user/IP.
- **Input validation**: Prevent malformed or malicious payloads.
- **Timeouts and quotas**: Limit resource usage per session or request.
- **Monitoring and alerting**: Detect unusual traffic patterns early.
