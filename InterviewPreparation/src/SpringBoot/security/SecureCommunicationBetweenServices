## 🔐 1. Use Mutual TLS (mTLS - mutual transport layer security)

### 🔹 What It Does:
- Encrypts traffic between services
- Authenticates both client and server using certificates

### 🔹 Tools:
- Istio or Linkerd (service mesh)
- Spring Boot with SSL configuration

```yaml
server:
  ssl:
    key-store: classpath:keystore.p12
    key-store-password: changeit
    key-store-type: PKCS12
```

## 🔑 2. JWT-Based Authentication Between Services

### 🔹 How It Works:
- Each service includes a **JWT token** in the `Authorization` header
- Receiving service validates the token (issuer, expiry, signature)

### 🔹 Benefits:
- Stateless and scalable
- Easy to propagate user context

```http
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6...
```

> Use Spring Security + OAuth2 Resource Server to validate tokens.

## 🧩 3. API Gateway as Security Gatekeeper

### 🔹 Role:
- Centralized authentication and authorization
- Validates tokens before routing to downstream services
- Applies rate limiting, IP whitelisting, and header sanitization

### 🔹 Example:
Spring Cloud Gateway + Keycloak or Okta

---

## 🛡️ 4. Service Mesh for Zero-Trust Security

### 🔹 What It Adds:
- Automatic mTLS
- Policy-based access control
- Traffic encryption and observability

### 🔹 Tools:
- Istio (with Envoy sidecars)
- Consul Connect

---

## 🔍 5. Secure Service Discovery

### 🔹 Risks:
- If Eureka or Consul is exposed, attackers can spoof services

### 🔹 Mitigation:
- Use TLS for registry communication
- Authenticate service registration
- Limit access to registry endpoints

## 🧠 6. Internal Firewalling & Network Segmentation

- Use Kubernetes Network Policies or cloud-native firewalls
- Restrict which services can talk to each other
- Block public access to internal APIs

---

## 🧪 7. Audit, Monitor, and Alert

- Use ELK stack, Prometheus, Grafana
- Monitor failed auth attempts, token misuse, and traffic anomalies
- Set up alerts for suspicious patterns

---

## 🧠 Real-World Example:

Imagine a payment service calling a user profile service:
- Gateway validates JWT and routes request
- Istio enforces mTLS between services
- Spring Security checks token scopes
- Prometheus tracks latency and error rates
- Audit logs capture request metadata for compliance
