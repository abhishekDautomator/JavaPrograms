Great question, Abhishek ‚Äî and one that often comes up in system design interviews and real-world architecture decisions. Let's break it down:

## ‚öîÔ∏è Java `HttpClient` vs Spring WebFlux (`WebClient`)

| Feature | **Java 11+ `HttpClient`** | **Spring WebFlux `WebClient`** |
|--------|----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Asynchronous Support** | Yes (via `CompletableFuture`) | Yes (via `Mono`/`Flux`) |
| **Reactive Streams** | No native support | Fully reactive (Project Reactor) |
| **Integration with Spring** | Minimal | Deep integration with Spring Boot/WebFlux |
| **Thread Model** | Uses virtual threads or platform threads | Non-blocking, event-loop based |
| **Use Case** | Lightweight async HTTP calls in plain Java apps or libraries | Reactive microservices, streaming APIs, backpressure handling |
| **Ease of Use in Spring Boot** | Requires manual wiring | Auto-configured and idiomatic in Spring Boot |
| **Streaming Support** | Limited | Excellent (e.g., SSE, WebSockets) |

## üß† When to Use What?

### ‚úÖ Use **Java `HttpClient`** if:
- You're building a **non-Spring** Java application or library.
- You want a **lightweight**, standard JDK solution.
- You‚Äôre okay with basic async via `CompletableFuture`.

### ‚úÖ Use **Spring WebFlux (`WebClient`)** if:
- You're already using **Spring Boot** or **Spring Cloud**.
- You need **full reactive support** (e.g., backpressure, streaming).
- You're building **high-throughput, non-blocking microservices**.
- You want **seamless integration** with Spring Security, Resilience4j, etc.

## üîß Real-World Analogy
Think of `HttpClient` as a **powerful screwdriver** ‚Äî great for general tasks.
But `WebClient` is a **Swiss Army knife** ‚Äî tailored for Spring-based, reactive, and cloud-native systems.

For your SAP interview, if asked, I‚Äôd recommend leaning toward **Spring WebFlux** for asynchronous communication in Spring Boot apps ‚Äî and be ready to explain why it‚Äôs more scalable and reactive-friendly.

Would you like a code comparison between `HttpClient` and `WebClient` for the same use case?
