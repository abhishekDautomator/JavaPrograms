Handling concurrency issues in a Java application is all about ensuring **correctness**, **performance**, and **thread safety** when multiple threads access shared resources. Here's a structured approach that senior developers like you, Abhishek, should master:

### üß® Common Concurrency Issues

1. **Race Conditions**
   Multiple threads read/write shared data simultaneously, leading to unpredictable results.

2. **Deadlocks**
   Threads wait indefinitely for each other‚Äôs locks.

3. **Starvation**
   A thread never gets CPU time or access to resources due to other greedy threads.

4. **Data Inconsistency**
   Shared data gets corrupted due to unsynchronized access.

### üõ†Ô∏è Strategies to Handle Concurrency

#### ‚úÖ 1. **Use Thread-Safe Data Structures**
- Prefer `ConcurrentHashMap`, `CopyOnWriteArrayList`, etc. over synchronized wrappers.
- These are optimized for concurrent access and reduce contention.

#### ‚úÖ 2. **Synchronization**
- Use `synchronized` blocks or methods to ensure mutual exclusion.
- Be cautious: overuse can lead to bottlenecks or deadlocks.

```java
synchronized (sharedResource) {
    // thread-safe access
}
```

#### ‚úÖ 3. **Use `volatile` for Visibility**
- Ensures changes to variables are visible across threads.
- Best for flags or simple state variables.

```java
private volatile boolean isRunning = true;
```

#### ‚úÖ 4. **Leverage `ExecutorService` and Thread Pools**
- Avoid manual thread creation.
- Use `Executors.newFixedThreadPool()` or `ScheduledExecutorService` for better control.

#### ‚úÖ 5. **Avoid Nested Locks and Circular Waits**
- Always acquire locks in a consistent order.
- Use `tryLock()` with timeouts to prevent deadlocks.

```java
if (lock.tryLock(100, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)) {
    // safe to proceed
}
```

#### ‚úÖ 6. **Immutability and Defensive Copies**
- Immutable objects are naturally thread-safe.
- Use `final` fields and avoid exposing internal state.

#### ‚úÖ 7. **Atomic Variables**
- Use `AtomicInteger`, `AtomicBoolean`, etc. for lock-free thread-safe operations.

```java
AtomicInteger counter = new AtomicInteger();
counter.incrementAndGet();
```

#### ‚úÖ 8. **Use Higher-Level Concurrency Utilities**
- `CountDownLatch`, `Semaphore`, `CyclicBarrier`, `BlockingQueue` help coordinate threads safely.

### üß† Real-World Example

Imagine a banking app where multiple threads update account balances. You‚Äôd:
- Use `synchronized` or `ReentrantLock` to protect balance updates.
- Use `ExecutorService` to manage threads.
- Use `ConcurrentHashMap` to store account data.
