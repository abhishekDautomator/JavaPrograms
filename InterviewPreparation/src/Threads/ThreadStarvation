**Thread starvation** happens when one or more threads are **perpetually denied access to resources**
because other threads keep hogging themâ€”often due to unfair scheduling or locking. Itâ€™s a subtle concurrency bug that can cripple performance in multi-threaded systems.

---

## ðŸ§  What Causes Thread Starvation?

- **Unfair locks**: Threads with lower priority or bad luck never acquire the lock
- **Busy threads monopolizing resources**
- **Synchronized blocks that never release**
- **Thread priorities misused**
- **Executor services with limited threads and long-running tasks**

---

## âœ… Ways to Fix or Prevent Thread Starvation

### ðŸ”¹ 1. **Use Fair Locks**

Javaâ€™s `ReentrantLock` supports fairness:

```java
Lock lock = new ReentrantLock(true); // true = fair
```

This ensures threads acquire the lock in **FIFO order**, reducing starvation.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 2. **Avoid Thread Priorities**

Java thread priorities (`Thread.setPriority()`) are **platform-dependent** and often ignored. Relying on them can cause starvation.

âœ… Tip: Stick to default priority unless you have a real-time system.

### ðŸ”¹ 3. **Use `Thread.yield()` Carefully**

`Thread.yield()` hints the scheduler to pause the current thread, but itâ€™s **not guaranteed**.
Use it only for **fine-tuned concurrency**, not starvation fixes.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 4. **Use `Executors` with Bounded Queues**

Avoid unbounded queues in thread pools. Use bounded queues and monitor task durations:

```java
ExecutorService executor = new ThreadPoolExecutor(
    5, 10, 60, TimeUnit.SECONDS,
    new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(100), // bounded queue
    new ThreadPoolExecutor.CallerRunsPolicy() // fallback
);
```

This prevents long-running tasks from starving others.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 5. **Break Long Locks into Smaller Chunks**

Donâ€™t hold locks for too long. Break critical sections into **smaller atomic operations**.

```java
synchronized (lock) {
    updateCache(); // fast
}
processData(); // outside lock
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ 6. **Use `ReadWriteLock` for Read-Heavy Workloads**

Allows multiple readers without blocking each other:

```java
ReadWriteLock rwLock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock(true); // fair
rwLock.readLock().lock();
// read-only operations
rwLock.readLock().unlock();
```

This avoids starvation of readers when writers dominate.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 7. **Monitor and Profile Threads**

Use tools like:
- **VisualVM**
- **JConsole**
- **Java Flight Recorder**

To detect blocked threads, long-held locks, and starvation patterns.
