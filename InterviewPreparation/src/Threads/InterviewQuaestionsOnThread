1. What are the various ways to create a THread in Java?
Ans. These are the primary ways to create threads in Java:

     Extending the Thread class
     Implementing the Runnable interface
     Using lambda expressions (Java 8+)
     Using ExecutorService
     Using Callable with Future

     Each method has its use cases, and choosing the right one depends on the specific
     requirements of your application,
     such as whether you need to return results or manage multiple threads efficiently.

2. run() vs start() method?
Ans. In Java, the run() and start() methods are both associated with the Thread class, but they
serve different purposes in the context of thread execution. Here’s a detailed comparison of the two:

     run() Method
     Purpose: The run() method contains the code that defines the behavior of the thread.
     When you create a thread, this is the method that will execute when the thread is started.

     Invocation: The run() method can be called directly like any other method.
     However, calling run() directly does not start a new thread; instead,
     it executes the run() method in the current thread.

     Usage:
     If you call run() directly, it runs in the context of the calling thread.
     It does not create a new thread of execution.

     start() Method
     Purpose: The start() method is used to initiate a new thread. When you call start(),
     it allocates system resources for the new thread and invokes the run() method in that
     new thread.

     Invocation: Calling start() begins the thread's life cycle. It does not return until
     the thread has finished executing its run() method.

     Usage:

     It creates a new thread of execution.
     The run() method is executed in the context of the new thread created by the start() method.


    Conclusion
    To execute code in a separate thread, always use the start() method. The run() method should only be
    overridden to define the thread's behavior, and it should not be called directly if
    you want to achieve concurrent execution.


-> ExecutorService:

Absolutely, Abhishek! Let’s break down **ExecutorService** and **thread pools**—two pillars of Java’s concurrency model that every senior developer should master.

### ⚙️ What Is `ExecutorService`?

`ExecutorService` is a **high-level API** in the `java.util.concurrent` package that simplifies running tasks asynchronously. Instead of manually creating and managing threads, you submit tasks to an executor, and it handles the rest.

```java
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);
executor.submit(() -> System.out.println("Task executed"));
executor.shutdown();
```

### 🧵 What Is a Thread Pool?

A **thread pool** is a collection of pre-created, reusable threads. When a task is submitted:
- If a thread is free, it picks up the task.
- If all threads are busy, the task waits in a queue.
- Threads **don’t die** after completing a task—they return to the pool.

> Think of it like a call center: operators (threads) handle calls (tasks). If all are busy, new callers wait in line.

---

### 🧠 Why Use `ExecutorService` and Thread Pools?

- ✅ **Performance**: Avoids overhead of creating/destroying threads repeatedly.
- ✅ **Scalability**: Limits the number of concurrent threads to prevent resource exhaustion.
- ✅ **Flexibility**: Supports `Runnable`, `Callable`, and returns `Future` for async results.
- ✅ **Control**: You can shut down gracefully or forcefully (`shutdown()` vs `shutdownNow()`).

### 🔧 Common Thread Pool Types

```java
Executors.newFixedThreadPool(n);     // Fixed number of threads
Executors.newCachedThreadPool();     // Dynamic thread pool (grows/shrinks)
Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor(); // One thread, tasks queued sequentially
Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(n); // For delayed or periodic tasks
```

---

### 🧪 Example with `Callable` and `Future`

```java
Callable<String> task = () -> "Hello from thread!";
Future<String> result = executor.submit(task);
System.out.println(result.get()); // Blocks until result is ready
```

### 💡 Interview Tip

If asked how you’d use it in a real-world app, say:

> “I’d use `ExecutorService` to manage background tasks like file uploads, API calls, or batch
processing. It improves responsiveness and avoids thread leaks by reusing threads efficiently.”
