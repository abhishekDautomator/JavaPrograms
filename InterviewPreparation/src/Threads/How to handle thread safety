## üßµ What Is Thread Safety?
Thread safety ensures that shared data structures or resources behave correctly when accessed by multiple threads concurrently ‚Äî without causing race conditions, data corruption, or unexpected behavior.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Strategies to Handle Thread Safety

### 1. **Synchronization**
- Use the `synchronized` keyword to lock critical sections.
- Example:
  ```java
  public synchronized void increment() {
      count++;
  }
  ```
- **Pros**: Simple to implement.
- **Cons**: Can lead to contention and reduced performance.

---

### 2. **Locks and Concurrency Utilities**
- Use `ReentrantLock`, `ReadWriteLock`, or `StampedLock` for finer control.
- Example:
  ```java
  Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();
  lock.lock();
  try {
      // critical section
  } finally {
      lock.unlock();
  }
  ```

---

### 3. **Atomic Variables**
- Use classes from `java.util.concurrent.atomic` like `AtomicInteger`, `AtomicReference`.
- These provide lock-free thread-safe operations.
- Example:
  ```java
  AtomicInteger counter = new AtomicInteger();
  counter.incrementAndGet();
  ```

---

### 4. **Concurrent Collections**
- Use thread-safe collections like `ConcurrentHashMap`, `CopyOnWriteArrayList`.
- Avoid using `Hashtable` or manually synchronizing `ArrayList`.

---

### 5. **Immutable Objects**
- Design objects to be immutable ‚Äî once created, their state cannot change.
- This eliminates synchronization needs entirely.

---

### 6. **Thread-Local Variables**
- Use `ThreadLocal` to give each thread its own isolated copy of a variable.
- Example:
  ```java
  ThreadLocal<SimpleDateFormat> formatter = ThreadLocal.withInitial(() -> new SimpleDateFormat("yyyy-MM-dd"));
  ```

---

### 7. **Executor Framework**
- Use `Executors` to manage thread pools and avoid manual thread creation.
- Helps control concurrency and resource usage.

---

## üß† Interview Tip
When asked this question, always:
- Mention **trade-offs** (e.g., performance vs safety).
- Refer to **real-world scenarios** (e.g., handling concurrent requests in a REST API).
- Discuss **testing strategies** (e.g., stress testing, race condition detection).
